# Sample golang web project structure
## Tech considerations



I'm an experienced senior software engineer looking to build a modern web application with the following tech stack:

**Backend:**
- Go (Golang) with Gin web framework (github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- SQLC for type-safe SQL (github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest)
- PostgreSQL database
- Testify for testing (github.com/stretchr/testify)
- log/slog for logging
- TailwindCSS for CSS
- DaisyUI for Prebuilt CSS styling

**Frontend:**
- HTMX for dynamic HTML interactions
- Alpine.js for lightweight JavaScript reactivity

**Goals:**
- Learn idiomatic Go patterns and best practices
- Build a production-ready application structure
- Implement clean separation between backend API and frontend templates
- Use SQLC for database interactions instead of an ORM
- Leverage HTMX for dynamic UI without heavy JavaScript
